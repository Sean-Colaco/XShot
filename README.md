3) After finishing a quick tutorial the user will be greeted by this screen where the game will begin. Everytime the user clicks on the target in the center of the screen it'll move to a randomly generated coordinate on the screen. The aim of the game is to hit the target as many times as possible in 10 seconds.

4) If the user misses the target and clicks on the wallpaper/grey background or doesn't manage to hit at least 10 targets in 10 seconds then the user will be greeted by this screen. The user can then decide to either play again or click the main menu button to go back to the home screen to change the difficulty.

6) If the user manages to hit 10 or more targets in 10 seconds then the user will be greeted with this screen. This screen displays how many targets the user hit, the highest amount of targets they've hit and allows them to play again for the chance to achieve a even higher score.
